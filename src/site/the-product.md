The HearMe app combines advanced audio processing techniques and AI, to assist authorities in assessing domestic violence risk level in reported households. Using the recorded and reported audio, authorities will be able to take appropriate action according to the risk level assigned, and in doing so take away the obstacle of police reporting from the witness.

HearMe consists of a control center that receives alerts for emergencies in its jurisdiction, and an app for residents’ use. When witnessing or hearing suspected distress or violence related voices users can use the HearMe app to record these from neighboring houses or apartments. After a recording has been sent, the user will receive a non-obligatory yes/no questionnaire in order to collect further meaningful insights and information. Recordings and inputs from adjacent users are clustered and then processed in order to generate higher quality audio.

Next, through using other metadata such as neighborhood, history calls and voice analysis, a risk level estimation is assigned using a color scale. Green indicates low risk, amber indicates intermediate risk, and red indicates the highest risk level.

When a red risk level is assigned, the police will be called to the location immediately. Under amber risk level authorities can begin taking preventative and confidential actions such as attempting to contact the victim or provide them with helpful information covertly over social media, for example. A green risk level doesn’t trigger any action, but the call is saved in the HearMe Database for future analysis.

In summary, through analyzing users’ recordings, and using their location the HearMe app can help detect domestic violence situations and ultimately save lives using minimal and non-invasive resources.
