HearMe combines advanced audio processing techniques and AI, to assist authorities in assessing domestic violence risk level in reported locations.​

Using a reported audio, together with a short questionnaire analysis, HearMe assigns a risk level to each report, helping authorities to take appropriate actions.

Top-notch super resolution neural network algorithm is used to take a single audio signal and improve its quality. It can also take multiple signals from adjacent users, cluster them and process them together in order to generate a higher quality audio.​

Through using other metadata such as neighborhood, historical reports and voice analysis, a ‘Risk Level’ is assigned to each report using a color scale:​
​<ul>
	<li><strong>Red</strong> – highest risk - police is called to the location immediately.</li>
	<li><strong>Amber</strong> – intermediate risk – initiate preventative-indirect actions such as attempting to covertly contact the victim or provide them with information over social media.​</li>
	<li><strong>Green</strong> – low risk - doesn’t trigger any action, but is saved for future analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h3>By analyzing users’ recordings, location and extra information provided - HearMe can help detect domestic violence situations and ultimately save lives using minimal and non-invasive resources.</h3>
