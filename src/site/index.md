HearMe is a life saving service that combats domestic abuse. A fusion of technology, AI and community awareness allows neighbors and by-passers to easily and anonymously report distress-indicating noises/voices to municipal authorities. And by doing so, save lives.

Often those hearing or witnessing domestic violence canâ€™t be sure, or feel confident that a call to the police is needed. This ambiguity can mean that vital intervention at a critical stage can be missed and lives can be lost unnecessarily.

HearMe takes away this ambiguity by passing the responsibility to the trained municipal authorities, taking the onus from the general public to make an official police report.
